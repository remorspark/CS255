# Project 8 Portfolio Submission
## 1. Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
      The client was the business Driverpass. They wanted a website that would allow users to track their progress
     through the driving course as well as allowing the client to take online tests and schedule drives with instructors.
## 2. What did you do particularly well?
    I believe my diagrams, specifically my Activity and Sequence Diagrams, were my best pieces of work in these assignments.
    These are super simple for me to understand because I learn better with visualizations of data and requirements rather 
    than plaintext explanations.
## 3. IF you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
    I would choose to revise my UML use case diagram. When looking at more examples of these, I found that I may have left
    out some important information, most notably the secretary. So to improve it, I would add a secretary actor to show
    their permissions and actions within the system.
## 4. How did you interpret the user's needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user's needs when designing?
    I interpreted the user's needs by analyzing the conversation with the DriverPass CEO and the IT professional for
    DriverPass. For example, they stated plainly how they wanted their system to work, and what they wanted included
    like the progression sidebar. This allowed me to create functional and nonfunctional requirements to get a better
    understanding of what I would or wouldn't need.

    It is important to consider the user's needs when designing because they are ultimately going to be the main
    users of the software. If their needs are unmet, the design of the system will not be worth the amount of time
    and effort it took to build it; especially if it is scrapped almost immmediately because the lack of 
    consideration towards the user's needs.
## 5. How did you approach designing software? WHat techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
    I approached designing software by ultimately considering the client's needs as well as using their 
    drawing of what they wanted the system to look like to create a big picture of their software. From
    there, I tried to separate out the smaller intricacies of the design in order to get a better feel 
    for the functional and nonfunctional requirements needed. 

    In the future, I will probably be using the diagrams we learned about in this course to develop 
    software as they were extremely helpful in allowing me to understand and remember how the client
    wanted things to operate.
